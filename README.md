# TOPIC: Functional Annotation
A repository for the lessons and tutorials for the Functional Annotation TOPIC channel of the [BVCN](https://biovcnet.github.io/)


## Prerequisites
* [A working Unix environment](https://github.com/biovcnet/biovcnet.github.io/wiki/1.-Setting-up-a-local-Linux-(or-Unix)-environment)
* [Experience with the command line](https://github.com/biovcnet/biovcnet.github.io/wiki/2.-Using-the-Command-line)

# Overview
This BVCN topic will cover:

* how to predict opening reading frames for all three domains of life
* the methodologies used to assign functions to proteins
* the intricacies of the specific tools and databases that can used for varying levels of specificity

# Lesson 1
### Title: How to predict open reading frames on DNA?
Goals

* Tools for predicting open reading frames for Bacteria and Archaea
* Tools for predicting open reading frames for Eukaryotes
* Converting open reading frames to predicted proteins
